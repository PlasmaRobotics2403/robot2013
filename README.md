# 2013 Plasma Robotics FRC Robot Code

Plasma Robotics' code for our 2013 FRC Robot, Frobo, for use in the 2013 game Ultimate Ascent.  Based on WPIlib 2014.  As it is designed for the CRIO, it has not been ported to WPIlib 2017 and does not have crosscompatibility with the 2017 Driver Station.  Robot Control requires a legacy installation of the Driver Station from 2014.
